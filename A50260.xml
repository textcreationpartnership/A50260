         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Fir≈øt, BEfore you begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the Highways with any Stone, Gravel, or other Materials, take care to ≈øee that all Ditches and Drains adjoining thereunto, be opened, and ≈øcoured, and made deep, or low enough to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33766:4"/>all ≈øtanding Water out of the ≈øame Highways, where the Water is an Annoyance. Al≈øo ≈øee that all Trees and Bu≈øhes growing in or next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to the Highways, and ob≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the ea≈øie pa≈ø≈øage of the People, be cut down, or kept low.

               <p>Secondly, See that the Earth and Soil ca≈øt out of the Ditches or Drains into the Highways, be not ≈øuffered to lye there by the ≈øpace of Six Months, to the Annoyance of the Highways; but be carried off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

               <p>Thirdly, See that all Ditches and Drains, in any Ground adjoining to the ≈øaid Ground adjoining to the Highways, where any ditching or ≈øcouring ought to be, for conveying the Water out of the Highway, over the Ground next adjoining, be kept from time to time, as need requires, ditched and ≈øcoured:

               <p>Fourthly, See if there be any Springs or Water-cour≈øes in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, making them deep and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; and if there be, you have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33766:5"/>full Authority to turn the ≈øame into any Ditch of the ≈øeveral Ground of any Per≈øon next adjoining to the ≈øaid Highways,
<note place="margin">5 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 13.</note> in ≈øuch manner as you ≈øhall think mo≈øt convenient.</p>
               <p>Tho≈øe are the means appointed by the Old Statutes (≈øtill in force) for draining the Highways in general, whether they be more or le≈øs than Twenty Foot broad: But for the draining and clearing ≈øuch Highways as are not Twenty Foot broad, there are other additional Means appointed in the Late Statute made for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Repairing of them,
<note place="margin">3 and 4 <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi>
                  </note> which be the≈øe that follow:</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Every Per≈øon that lays in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ≈øuch Highway any Timber, Stone, Straw,
<note place="margin">3 and 4 <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi>
                  </note> or other Matter what≈øoever, whereby the ≈øame ≈øhall be ob≈øtructed or annoyed, Forfeits for every ≈øuch Offence Five Shillings, to be Levied by Warrant of Two Ju≈øtices of your Divi≈øion, or in default thereof, any Neighbouring Ju≈øtices.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:33766:5"/>
               <p>Secondly, Every Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor of Lands next adjoining to the Highway where any ≈øuch Matter lyes, mu≈øt remove the ≈øame,
<note place="margin">3 and 4 <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi>
                  </note> (and may take it to his own U≈øe) which if he neglects to do within Ten Days after you have given him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, he Forfeits al≈øo Five Shillings, to be Levied as afore≈øaid, for every ≈øuch neglect.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If any Tree, Bu≈øh, or Shrub, ≈øhall ≈øtand or grow in ≈øuch Highway, and be not cut down and carried away by the Owner of the Soil, where the ≈øame doth ≈øtand or grow,
<note place="margin">3 and 4 W. and M.</note> within Ten Days after you have given him notice, he ≈øhall For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Five Shillings for every neglect, to be Levied as afore≈øaid.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, (Furthermore) what Defaults or Annoyances you ≈øhall find in the Highways, or in Cau≈øeys, Bridges, Ditches, Hedges, Trees, Water-cour≈øes, Drains, or Gutters next adjoining to the ≈øame, within your Precincts, you are to give pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick notice thereof from time to time,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33766:6"/>in the Pari≈øh Church the next <hi>Sunday,</hi> immediately after Sermon ended: And if the ≈øame ≈øhall not be removed, and amended within Thirty Days after ≈øuch notice given, then you are to do the ≈øame within Thirty Days after, and di≈øpo≈øe of the Annoyances to and for the Repair of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways;
<note place="margin">2 and 4 W. and M.</note> and you ≈øhall be Reimbur≈øed your Charges in ≈øo doing, by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties who ≈øhould have done the ≈øame, upon your Application to any one of the next Ju≈øtices.</p>
               <p>Note al≈øo, That you are required under the Penalty of Five Pounds, to pre≈øent upon Oath to one of the next Ju≈øtices, within Fourteen Days after your fir≈øt Acceptance of your Office, and ≈øo from time to time, every Four Months, during the ≈øame, the ≈øtate and condition of all the Roads, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Highways, Water-cour≈øes, Bridges, Cau≈øeys, and Pavements within your Pari≈øh,
<note place="margin">3 and 4 W. and M.</note> which are to be repaired at your Pari≈øh Charge.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:33766:6"/>
               <p>And I mu≈øt crave leave al≈øo to Note, That it ≈øeems very equal and rea≈øonable, That when Ditches, and Drains next the Highway, which are to be ≈øcoured by the Tenant (who Labours hard, and fares meanly, to pay his Rent) are once a Year ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ≈øcoured by him, and the Soil carried away; then the ≈øame ≈øhould afterwards, for that Year, be kept in repair by you: For they are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward out of repair, only by the pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing of Carts, Hor≈øes, and other Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel in the Common Highway, and not by the Tenant's default.</p>

               <p>Fir≈øt, WHen you have remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Annoyances, and cau≈øed the Ditches and Drains next adjoining to the Highways, to be ≈øufficiently opened and ≈øcoured by the Owners of the Soil, then do you cau≈øe all the ≈øtanding Water in the Highway, to be drained or conveyed into tho≈øe Ditches and Drains, by new Trenches or Gutters; which ought to be con≈øtantly done, e≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after every great fall of Rain; for if the Water ≈øtands long in any part of the Highways, they will be ≈øoon marred, and then require more Charge to be repaired, e≈øpecially in Clayey Ground. And (in truth) the ≈øuffering of Water to ≈øtand in the Highways, e≈øpecially in tho≈øe that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33766:7"/>are much Carted, is the fir≈øt and principal Cau≈øe of their decay and ruin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, After the Water is drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Highways, and the Ground become dry, then, and not before, lay on your Materials for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing; except in Winter-time there happens to be Gulls, or ≈øuch deep Holes which renders the Ways im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øible, and ≈øo require pre≈øent mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Where the Rutts, or Padways are deep, fir≈øt lay Faggots, or Bu≈øhes of white or black Thorn cro≈øs-way, ≈øuffering them to be cru≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down by Loaden Carts drawn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and when you lay Stones on them, then omit not to cover the Stones with Gravel, or ≈øuch like hard Rubbi≈øh; for this will get into the empty ≈øpaces between the Stones, and ≈øo fa≈øten them together, that Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheels and Hor≈øe-feet cannot ea≈øily di≈øplace them, which otherwi≈øe would be, and your Charge half lo≈øt.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:33766:8"/>
               <p>That which doth much Gull and Marr the Common Highway, is the draught of Waggons and Carts with Burdens of exceeding weight, as 40, 50, 60, and ≈øometimes 70 Hundred Weight; one of tho≈øe Carriages doth more hurt to the Way than twenty of others, everyone ≈øeverally Loaden but with Twenty Hundred. There was (indeed) a Remedy provided again≈øt this Inconvenience, by the Statute 14 <hi>Car.</hi>

               <p>Thus far I have provided to inform you of the Power, and Means, given and appointed by the Statutes for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the Highways; and now I ≈øhall add my own Animadver≈øion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the manner of Charging Per≈øons to the repairing of them.</p>
               <p>To ≈øpeak (then) plain, the way and manner of Charging Per≈øons by the Old Statutes ≈øtill in force, ≈øeems to me as unequal and oppre≈ø≈øive, as it is uncertain and ob≈øcure. And I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that to Charge all Per≈øons by an A≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øment only, made according to the Rate of the Poors Tax, will be more Equal, more Ea≈øie, and le≈øs Charge to the Pari≈øh, than to Charge Per≈øons by a <hi>Plow-land,</hi> and by a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33766:16"/>
                  <hi>Draught</hi> or <hi>Plow,</hi> and by being meer Cottagers. And this will appear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if all Circum≈øtances be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and con≈øidered, of which I ≈øhall here offer only ≈øome.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, By this means of Charging Per≈øons by ≈øuch an A≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øment, the Surveyors will be enabled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Carriages in times needful and convenient, and with ≈øuch Carters and Labourers as will for their Hire, carry full Loads, and labour hard; whereas on the other hand, tho≈øe that are Charged to find and ≈øend in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages with their own Men, will Load and Draw as they plea≈øe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves for their own ea≈øe, come and go at their own time and lei≈øure, and ≈øo not perform half ≈øo much work in a Day, as the other that are Hired.</p>
               <p>Al≈øo the Surveyors will be enabled to Hire ≈øuch Day labourers as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and will be Indu≈øtrious for their Hire; one of which (as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved) will do more work at the Highways in one Day, than is done
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33766:16"/>by ≈øix or ≈øeven of others that come to work upon their own account as Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagers, or that are ≈øent in by them. The≈øe are they that call them≈øelves <hi>The King's Highway-Men,</hi> when they beg of all Travellers that come near them; but they are commonly called, <hi>The King's Loyterers,</hi> who work when they li≈øt, come and go at their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, and ≈øpend mo≈øt of their time in ≈øtanding ≈øtill and prating, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their Fellows, whom they ≈øend out from their Work, mo≈øt ≈øhamefully, to ≈øtop Pa≈ø≈øengers for a <hi>Large≈øs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Al≈øo all Inhabitants will be A≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed proportionably to what they Occupy in Lands, or Po≈ø≈øe≈øs in Goods, which is agreeable to Equity: And the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or Husbandman, who doth mo≈øt hurt to the Highways, by his often Carting, for his proper Benefit, will pay the mo≈øt in the A≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øment, which is al≈øo rea≈øonable.</p>
               <p>Whereas on the other hand, by the pre≈øent manner of Charging Per≈øons,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33766:17"/>the poor Hou≈øholder or Cottager, who≈øe Family is maintained with Bread only by his daily Labour, is Charged with as much Duty to the Highways, as other Rich Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants (e≈øpecially in Corporate and Market-Towns) who are worth, ≈øome of them, 500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> 1000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and ≈øome, more; which is very unequal and oppre≈ø≈øive.</p>
