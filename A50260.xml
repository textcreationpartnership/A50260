         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Firſt, BEfore you begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the Highways with any Stone, Gravel, or other Materials, take care to ſee that all Ditches and Drains adjoining thereunto, be opened, and ſcoured, and made deep, or low enough to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33766:4"/>all ſtanding Water out of the ſame Highways, where the Water is an Annoyance. Alſo ſee that all Trees and Buſhes growing in or next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to the Highways, and obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the eaſie paſſage of the People, be cut down, or kept low. And if the Owner of the Ground, or Soil, to which the Ditches, Trees, Hedges, or Buſhes do belong, ſhall neglect to keep them ſo ſeour'd and cut as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, then you muſt preſent him, within one Month after default, to the next Juſtice of the Peace, who is to certifie the ſame at the next Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seſſions, where the Defaulter is to be Fined at the Diſcretion of the Juſtices,
<note place="margin">5 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 13. And 18 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 10.</note> according to the 5 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 13. but according to the 18 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 10. the Defaulter ſhall Forfeit for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Default Ten Shillings.</p>
               <p>Secondly, See that the Earth and Soil caſt out of the Ditches or Drains into the Highways, be not ſuffered to lye there by the ſpace of Six Months, to the Annoyance of the Highways; but be carried off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33766:4"/>that time, by him that holds the Ground next adjoining, and that ſcoured the Ditch.
<note place="margin">18 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 10.</note> Which if he ſhall neglect to do, he Forfeits Twelve Pence for every Load ſo caſt up, and you are to preſent his default at next Quarter Seſſions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, See that all Ditches and Drains, in any Ground adjoining to the ſaid Ground adjoining to the Highways, where any ditching or ſcouring ought to be, for conveying the Water out of the Highway, over the Ground next adjoining, be kept from time to time, as need requires, ditched and ſcoured:
<note place="margin">18 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 10. § 6. and 9.</note> And if he that holds that Ground ſhall neglect to keep the ſame ſo ditched and ſcoured, he Forfeits Twelve Pence for every Rod not ſo done and kept, and you are to preſent his default at next Quarter Seſſions.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, See if there be any Springs or Water-courſes in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, making them deep and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; and if there be, you have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33766:5"/>full Authority to turn the ſame into any Ditch of the ſeveral Ground of any Perſon next adjoining to the ſaid Highways,
<note place="margin">5 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 13.</note> in ſuch manner as you ſhall think moſt convenient.</p>
               <p>Thoſe are the means appointed by the Old Statutes (ſtill in force) for draining the Highways in general, whether they be more or leſs than Twenty Foot broad: But for the draining and clearing ſuch Highways as are not Twenty Foot broad, there are other additional Means appointed in the Late Statute made for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Repairing of them,
<note place="margin">3 and 4 <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi>
                  </note> which be theſe that follow:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Every Perſon that lays in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Highway any Timber, Stone, Straw,
<note place="margin">3 and 4 <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi>
                  </note> or other Matter whatſoever, whereby the ſame ſhall be obſtructed or annoyed, Forfeits for every ſuch Offence Five Shillings, to be Levied by Warrant of Two Juſtices of your Diviſion, or in default thereof, any Neighbouring Juſtices.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:33766:5"/>
               <p>Secondly, Every Poſſeſſor of Lands next adjoining to the Highway where any ſuch Matter lyes, muſt remove the ſame,
<note place="margin">3 and 4 <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi>
                  </note> (and may take it to his own Uſe) which if he neglects to do within Ten Days after you have given him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, he Forfeits alſo Five Shillings, to be Levied as aforeſaid, for every ſuch neglect.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If any Tree, Buſh, or Shrub, ſhall ſtand or grow in ſuch Highway, and be not cut down and carried away by the Owner of the Soil, where the ſame doth ſtand or grow,
<note place="margin">3 and 4 W. and M.</note> within Ten Days after you have given him notice, he ſhall For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Five Shillings for every neglect, to be Levied as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, (Furthermore) what Defaults or Annoyances you ſhall find in the Highways, or in Cauſeys, Bridges, Ditches, Hedges, Trees, Water-courſes, Drains, or Gutters next adjoining to the ſame, within your Precincts, you are to give pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick notice thereof from time to time,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33766:6"/>in the Pariſh Church the next <hi>Sunday,</hi> immediately after Sermon ended: And if the ſame ſhall not be removed, and amended within Thirty Days after ſuch notice given, then you are to do the ſame within Thirty Days after, and diſpoſe of the Annoyances to and for the Repair of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways;
<note place="margin">2 and 4 W. and M.</note> and you ſhall be Reimburſed your Charges in ſo doing, by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties who ſhould have done the ſame, upon your Application to any one of the next Juſtices.</p>
               <p>Note alſo, That you are required under the Penalty of Five Pounds, to preſent upon Oath to one of the next Juſtices, within Fourteen Days after your firſt Acceptance of your Office, and ſo from time to time, every Four Months, during the ſame, the ſtate and condition of all the Roads, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Highways, Water-courſes, Bridges, Cauſeys, and Pavements within your Pariſh,
<note place="margin">3 and 4 W. and M.</note> which are to be repaired at your Pariſh Charge.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:33766:6"/>
               <p>And I muſt crave leave alſo to Note, That it ſeems very equal and reaſonable, That when Ditches, and Drains next the Highway, which are to be ſcoured by the Tenant (who Labours hard, and fares meanly, to pay his Rent) are once a Year ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſcoured by him, and the Soil carried away; then the ſame ſhould afterwards, for that Year, be kept in repair by you: For they are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward out of repair, only by the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Carts, Horſes, and other Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel in the Common Highway, and not by the Tenant's default.</p>

               <head>Section II. <hi>Of Draining the Highways, and Repairing them.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Firſt, WHen you have remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Annoyances, and cauſed the Ditches and Drains next adjoining to the Highways, to be ſufficiently opened and ſcoured by the Owners of the Soil, then do you cauſe all the ſtanding Water in the Highway, to be drained or conveyed into thoſe Ditches and Drains, by new Trenches or Gutters; which ought to be conſtantly done, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after every great fall of Rain; for if the Water ſtands long in any part of the Highways, they will be ſoon marred, and then require more Charge to be repaired, eſpecially in Clayey Ground. And (in truth) the ſuffering of Water to ſtand in the Highways, eſpecially in thoſe that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33766:7"/>are much Carted, is the firſt and principal Cauſe of their decay and ruin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, After the Water is drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Highways, and the Ground become dry, then, and not before, lay on your Materials for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing; except in Winter-time there happens to be Gulls, or ſuch deep Holes which renders the Ways im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible, and ſo require preſent mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Where the Rutts, or Padways are deep, firſt lay Faggots, or Buſhes of white or black Thorn croſs-way, ſuffering them to be cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down by Loaden Carts drawn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and when you lay Stones on them, then omit not to cover the Stones with Gravel, or ſuch like hard Rubbiſh; for this will get into the empty ſpaces between the Stones, and ſo faſten them together, that Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheels and Horſe-feet cannot eaſily diſplace them, which otherwiſe would be, and your Charge half loſt.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:33766:8"/>
               <p>That which doth much Gull and Marr the Common Highway, is the draught of Waggons and Carts with Burdens of exceeding weight, as 40, 50, 60, and ſometimes 70 Hundred Weight; one of thoſe Carriages doth more hurt to the Way than twenty of others, everyone ſeverally Loaden but with Twenty Hundred. There was (indeed) a Remedy provided againſt this Inconvenience, by the Statute 14 <hi>Car.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">14 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5.</note> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5: wherein the Carriage in a Cart or Waggon was limitted to 20 Hundred Weight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Firſt of <hi>October</hi> and the Firſt of <hi>May;</hi> and to 30 Hundred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Firſt of <hi>May</hi> and the Firſt of <hi>October;</hi> but that Law is expired, and ſo you have no Remedy in this Caſe, until it ſhall pleaſe the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to provide one.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, You are required, under ſuch Penalty as the Juſtices ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, not exceeding Forty Shillings, to ſuffer no Travelling <hi>Waggon,
<note place="margin">22 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12.</note> Wayn, Cart, or Carriage, wherein any Burdens, Goods, or Wares are carried,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33766:8"/>to paſs your Highways with above Five Horſe-beaſts at length; except only ſuch Carts and Carriages as are employed in and about Husbandry, and Manuring of Lands, and in the Carrying of Hay, Straw, Corn unthreſht, Coal, Chalk, Timber for Shipping, Materials for Building, Stones of all ſorts, or ſuch Ammunition or Artillery which ſhall be for His Majeſties Service.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>By a <hi>Plow-land,</hi> in the Statute, is not meant the quality of Land, as <hi>Arable</hi> or <hi>Tillage,</hi> but the quantity of Lands, whether the ſame be Arable or Paſture.

               <p>Secondly, Every <hi>other</hi> Perſon that keepeth a <hi>Draught</hi> or <hi>Plow</hi> in your Pariſh,

<note place="margin">2 and 3 P. and M.</note> ſhould ſend in Lieu there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of two able Men to work for that Day.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Every Perſon and Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age aforeſaid, ſhall have and bring with them ſuch Shovels, and other Tools as be neceſſary for their work,

               <p>Sixthly, In ſuch places where there is no uſe of Carts and Teams for mending the Highways, but the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is to carry Materials on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, or by other kinds of Carriages;
<note place="margin">22 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12.</note> there the Inhabitants ſhall ſend ſuch their Horſes and other Carriages in Lieu of Carts, with two able Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in like manner as with Carts.</p>

               <p>Alſo you are required to return the Defaulters within one Month after every default made, as you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed, to return the default of Labourers.</p>
               <p>Eighthly and Laſtly, If after your uſing all thoſe means herein before mentioned, the Juſtices of the Peace ſhall be ſatisfied, that the Highways, Cauſeys, Bridges, Streets, or Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments within your Pariſh, cannot be thereby ſufficiently repaired, then the ſaid Juſtices, at their General Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Seſſions, are to allow and order one or more Aſſeſſment to be made upon the Inhabitants of your Pariſh, for the raiſing of Moneys to repair,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33766:15"/>as need ſhall require, by Diſtreſs of the Goods of thoſe that ſhall refuſe to pay; provided that no ſuch Aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made in one Year, ſhall exceed the Rate of Six-pence in the Pound of the Yearly Value of Lands and Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; nor the Rate of Six-pence for Twenty Pounds in Perſonal Eſtate.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have provided to inform you of the Power, and Means, given and appointed by the Statutes for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the Highways; and now I ſhall add my own Animadverſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the manner of Charging Perſons to the repairing of them.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak (then) plain, the way and manner of Charging Perſons by the Old Statutes ſtill in force, ſeems to me as unequal and oppreſſive, as it is uncertain and obſcure. And I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that to Charge all Perſons by an Aſſeſſment only, made according to the Rate of the Poors Tax, will be more Equal, more Eaſie, and leſs Charge to the Pariſh, than to Charge Perſons by a <hi>Plow-land,</hi> and by a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33766:16"/>
                  <hi>Draught</hi> or <hi>Plow,</hi> and by being meer Cottagers. And this will appear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if all Circumſtances be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and conſidered, of which I ſhall here offer only ſome.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By this means of Charging Perſons by ſuch an Aſſeſſment, the Surveyors will be enabled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Carriages in times needful and convenient, and with ſuch Carters and Labourers as will for their Hire, carry full Loads, and labour hard; whereas on the other hand, thoſe that are Charged to find and ſend in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages with their own Men, will Load and Draw as they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their own eaſe, come and go at their own time and leiſure, and ſo not perform half ſo much work in a Day, as the other that are Hired.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Surveyors will be enabled to Hire ſuch Day labourers as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and will be Induſtrious for their Hire; one of which (as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) will do more work at the Highways in one Day, than is done
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33766:16"/>by ſix or ſeven of others that come to work upon their own account as Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagers, or that are ſent in by them. Theſe are they that call themſelves <hi>The King's Highway-Men,</hi> when they beg of all Travellers that come near them; but they are commonly called, <hi>The King's Loyterers,</hi> who work when they liſt, come and go at their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſpend moſt of their time in ſtanding ſtill and prating, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their Fellows, whom they ſend out from their Work, moſt ſhamefully, to ſtop Paſſengers for a <hi>Largeſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo all Inhabitants will be Aſſeſſed proportionably to what they Occupy in Lands, or Poſſeſs in Goods, which is agreeable to Equity: And the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or Husbandman, who doth moſt hurt to the Highways, by his often Carting, for his proper Benefit, will pay the moſt in the Aſſeſſment, which is alſo reaſonable.</p>
               <p>Whereas on the other hand, by the preſent manner of Charging Perſons,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33766:17"/>the poor Houſholder or Cottager, whoſe Family is maintained with Bread only by his daily Labour, is Charged with as much Duty to the Highways, as other Rich Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants (eſpecially in Corporate and Market-Towns) who are worth, ſome of them, 500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> 1000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and ſome, more; which is very unequal and oppreſſive.</p>
               <p>And although thoſe that keep Draughts or Carriages for Hire, and Occupy little or no Land, may, by this way of Aſſeſſment, eſcape with paying little, and yet wear out the Highways much; that may in reaſon be diſpenced with, conſidering that thoſe Hired Carts are kept generally for the Accommodating of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, as they ſhall have occaſion, paying for the uſe of them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, By this way of Charging all Perſons by ſuch an Aſſeſſment, the Surveyors may once a Year Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy poor People, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to gather thoſe Stones off of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33766:17"/>Lands, that are to be gathered for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiring the Highways, and allow them for gathering the ſame, after the Rate of 8 <abbr>
                     <hi>d.</hi>
                  </abbr> 10 <abbr>
                     <hi>d.</hi>
                  </abbr> or 12 <abbr>
                     <hi>d.</hi>
                  </abbr> a Cart-load, or ſuch a price as the Stones are truly worth to buy, when gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; by which means the poor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers and their Children will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to work hard, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for want of Employment, would perhaps want Bread.</p>
               <p>But we muſt wait, and be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with things as they are, till this Matter ſhall be taken into Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a Parliament, and altered; and in the mean time you muſt Charge all Perſons, as the preſent Laws in being have directed.</p>
